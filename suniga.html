                As a freshman here in FEU Roosevelt Marikina, I really enjoy every events here at our school. I make the most out of it every single event because I know it will happen only once a year. So far, I have no plans to leave this school, and I'm starting to have new set of friends that are kind and have the "vibe."

                I would like to thank FEU Roosevelt Marikina by giving us students a wonderful event that we really enjoyed. I cant' wait for the upcoming events that will be held on FEU Roosevelt Marikina and Cainta branch. I will cherish every moment, because this will be my last memories during my student journey. College Life is fun, so I will make the most out of it.
