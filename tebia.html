                    <p><em>On Halloween, we decorated our costumes. Each student prepared for the event, which took place next to the gym court. We held a parade around the school.</em></p>

            <p>
                Throughout all these events, I truly felt the joy and happiness at FEU Roosevelt. I met amazing people, and even though there were moments when we didn't agree, it was okay because we were all part of something special. This semester at FEU Roosevelt Marikina has been filled with happiness and memorable experiences.
